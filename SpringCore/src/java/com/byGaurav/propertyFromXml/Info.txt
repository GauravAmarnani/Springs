This file contains all the information about the package (com.byGaurav.propertyFromXml).

This package contains 2 Java Classes : Company , Fresher.

Company is the main class.

Basically this package uses the property file from the bean file linked to the java class.

The code for linking property file is :
<context:property-placeholder location="filename.properties"/>

The code to write to get values from property files is as follows :
<bean id="fresher" class="com.byGaurav.propertyFromXml.Fresher">
    <property name="name" value="${fresher.name}"/>
    <property name="score" value="${fresher.score}"/>
    <property name="strength" value="${fresher.strength}"/>
</bean>

The code to write inside the property file is :
fresher.name = "Gaurav"
fresher.score = 95
fresher.strength = "Core Java , Advanced Java , Springs , Cassandra , Jenkins , Git."

Note : The type of java object you are passing matters.
Eg : You can't pass a String value instead of an int or Integer type.
